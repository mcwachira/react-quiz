## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

1. I learned how to use the useReducer hook to manage the state in my app
2. I learned how to create a Netlify function to serve  the react questions.




### Continued development

The goal in the future is 
1. Get my questions from an external API instead of a JSON file
2. To specify the difficulties of each question and enabler the user to choose questions based on difficulty level
3. Enable the user to sign in and solve the questions. 
### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://www.react.com) - This helped me to understand hooks and the useReducer Hook. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
